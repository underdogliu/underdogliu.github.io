-------------------
I am an engineer and researcher on speech technologies. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Yamagishi lab @ National Institute of Informatics](https://nii-yamagishilab.github.io/). My primary research focus revolves around multi-modal learning (speaker-oriented), spoofing detection, and speech synthesis.

I have obtained my BEng, MSc, and PhD degree in 2016, 2017, and 2023 respectively. The PhD program is jointly funded by [School of Computing @ Uni. of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/cs) and [MULTISPEECH @ Inria Nancy Grand Est](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/). From 2017 to 2019, I was an R&D engineer at [Emotech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emotech-ltd/), a London-based startup (although I was based at Edinburgh). I have served as a regular reviewer in both speech/audio (ICASSP, Interspeech, TASLP) and machine learning (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML) related venues.

Some fun and undisturbing facts about me:
* I find solace in training and participating various ball sports. They are responsible to my procrastination.
* I am a huge fan of rap music for decades, without any genre preference. I almost never avoid controversial content in rap songs; it's a reflection of embracing the diverse aspects of life. I used to chop, but no longer at that level anymore.
* I don't like intentional traveling yet life has made me a bit of a nomad. I've been living (not short-term traveling) in 8 cities among 5 countries.
* I've transformed from a digital product hoarder into a practicing minimalist.

More detailed ver. of CV is available on request. Cheers to the journey ahead!
