-------------------
I am an incoming Assistant Professor at the [School of AI and Advanced Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-ai-and-advanced-computing), based at the newly established [XJTLU Entrepreneur College](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/entrepreneur-college-taicang) in [Taicang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taicang). 

My primary research interests span the following directions:
 * Multi-Modal Representation Learning (with a focus on audio)
 * Audio Security (deepfake detection & analysis, replay detection, speaker verification)
 * Speech Recognition
 * Speech Synthesis
 * Speech Perception

I serve as a regular reviewer at speech and audio venues (ICASSP, Interspeech, TASLP) as well as machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML). I am also an active contributor to open-source projects and community challenges (e.g. [ASVspoof](https://www.asvspoof.org), [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)).

**Few Personal Fun Facts**
* I find solace in training for and competing in various ball sports. They are largely responsible for my procrastination.
* I have been a fan of rap music for decades, with no particular genre preference. I almost never avoid the controversial content in rap; to me, it reflects an openness to the diverse and unfiltered aspects of life. I used to try MC and [chopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopper_(rap)), though not quite at that level anymore.
* I never acknowledge myself as a nomad, yet life makes me one by letting me have lived (not just visited) in 8 cities across 5 countries.
* I have made the full journey from digital product hoarder to practicing minimalist.

A more detailed CV is available upon request. Cheers to the journey ahead!
