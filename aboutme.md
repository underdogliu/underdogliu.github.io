### Lil bit about me
I am an engineer and researcher on speech technologies. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Yamagishi lab @ National Institute of Informatics](https://nii-yamagishilab.github.io/). My primary research focus revolves around speaker recognition and spoofing detection.

I meanwhile am at the end of my journey to persue a PhD degree, jointly funded by [School of Computing @ Uni. of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/cs) and [MULTISPEECH @ Inria Nancy Grand Est](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/). I am supervised by [Md Sahidullah](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=jRcYfsQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Tomi Kinnunen](http://cs.joensuu.fi/pages/tkinnu/webpage/). Before the PhD study, I was an R&D engineer at [Emotech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emotech-ltd/).

Some fun and undisturbing facts about me:
* I find solace and joy in training and participating in various ball sports. They are responsible to my procrastination.
* I am a huge fan of rap music for decades, without any genre preference. I almost never avoid controversial content in rap songs; it's a reflection of embracing the diverse aspects of life. I used to chop, but no longer at that level anymore.
* I don't like intentional traveling yet life has made me a bit of a nomad. I've been living (not short-term traveling) in 8 cities among 5 countries.
* I've transformed from a digital product hoarder into a practicing minimalist.

More detailed ver. of CV is available on request. Cheers to the journey ahead!
