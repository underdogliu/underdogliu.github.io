Yo what's up? How can you be that bored which leads you to this place, having any interest to an "underdog"?

-------------------
### Little bit on me
I am Underdog, a research engineer in Speech & Spoken Language Processing. Currently I am working as a 3rd-year PhD candidate, jointly funded by [School of Computing @ Uni. of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/cs) and [MULTISPEECH @ Inria Nancy Grand Est](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/). Previously I was an R&D engineer at [Emotech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emotech-ltd/).

Some fun and undisturbing facts about me:
* In my spare time I love running, working out, play basketball and football a lot. These are main causes of my procrastination.
* I don't like intentional traveling at all but somehow I'm forced to be a nomad. Since the first time I went abroad, I've been living (not short-term traveling) at 6 cities in 5 years.
* I'm a former hoarder and a current minimalism practitioner.
* I currently speak Python 3.8+, with [black](https://github.com/psf/black) accent.

More detailed ver. of CV is available on request. Cheers!
