<!-- Yo what's up? How can you be that bored which leads you to this place, having any interest to an "underdog"? -->
I am now (almost) on the job market. Please DM me on Linkedin or send me email if you interested to hire me! 

I have primary interest in postdoctoral research positions about speech processing, but definitely open to high-tier industry positions as well. I expect myself to graduate at the 2nd half of 2023.

### Little bit on me
I am an engineer and researcher on speech technologies. Currently I am working as a 3rd-year PhD candidate, jointly funded by [School of Computing @ Uni. of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/cs) and [MULTISPEECH @ Inria Nancy Grand Est](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/). Before the PhD, I was an R&D engineer at [Emotech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emotech-ltd/).

Some fun and undisturbing facts about me:
* In my spare time I love training and playing ball sports. These are main causes of my procrastination.
* I am a huge fan of rap music for decades, without any genre preference. I almost never avoid swearing and other bad stuff in rap songs, which makes me embrace and cherish my ordinary life.
* I don't like intentional traveling but somehow I've been a nomad. Since I went abroad, I've been living (not short-term traveling) in 7 cities in 4 countries during last 5 years.
* I'm a former hoarder for digital product while now a current minimalism practitioner.
